 onis - CHANGELOG
==================
http://verplant.org/onis/

  0.8.1 - Bugfixing and other corrections
 =========================================
 - Ignoring users (using the special user-name ``ignore'') has been fixed.
 - A manpage for onis has been written. It can be generated out of the ``onis''
   file using pod2man.
 - All bars now use relative scaling, i.e. the stylesheets have more control
   about their size.
 - Packaging information for RPM-based distributions and Debian have been
   added.



  0.8.0 - All new persistency
 =============================
 - This release features a complete rewrite of the persistency-code. The
   new code is much more powerful and flexible. In addition to using
   Storable onis can now use DBM-files too. This is the first step towards
   database-backed storage.
 - A plugin showing the channel activity based on weekdays has been added.
 - A plugin showing the channel activity over the last 31 days
   (configurable, of course) has been added.
 - The Userdetails-plugin has been extended to display the data of the above
   plugins, too.
 - Many, many code and documentation fixes and additions.



  0.7.2 - Spanish translation
 =============================
 - Javier Garcia Alarcon (Sorry, my term didn't like all the fancy spanish
   characters :/) has contributed a spanish translation for onis. Thank
   you very much :)



  0.7.1 - Improved aging and new translation
 ============================================
 - ``Aging'' now only occurs once a day, so you can generate hourly-stats
   without losing data..
 - Christoffer Jonsson has sent in a swedish translation. Thank you very
   much :)
 - Fixes in the CSS files allow the MSIE to render the generated files
   correctly. You have to resize the images to 50 by 50 pixels though.. If
   you don't like that you'll have to edit the CSS files yourself..



  0.7.0 - Aging data and themes
 ===============================
 - A parser for EnergyMech logfiles has been contributed/added. Thanks to
   Korbinian Rosenegger :) Unfortunately it doesn't quite work, yet..
 - When including images in the stats the images will now be displayed in
   the Userdetails-stats, too.
 - There is a new ``public_page'' option: When set to ``true'' (the
   default setting) the page will eventually show up on onis' homepage.
 - There is now support for simple themes. Basically, they are ordered
   configs.. Also, the themes have been improved a bit..
 - Words, Nicks and Ident `age' now. This means, that a lot less diskspace
   will be used to store persistent data, because useless old data will be
   removed..
 - The nicks-Plugin is now RFC2812 compliant.



  0.6.1 - Bugfixes
 ==================
 - A display bug with the ``Conversations'' plugin has been fixed.
 - POD documentation for some modules has been improved/added.
 - Bjørn Danielsen has contributed a norwegian translation.
   Thanks a lot :)
 - Handling of unidentified nicks has been improved. People who don't use
   the users-configuration and run onis on small logs (daily logs or so)
   may see a huge improvment here..



  0.6.0 - Detailed nick statistics
 ==================================
 - The new ``Userdetails''-plugin provides detailed per-user-statistics
   for people that are into that kind of things (ie. me ;).
 - The width of the bars of the ``Conversation''-plugin is calculated more
   appropriately now.
 - Typos in lang/german.lang have been fixed.
 - Persistency files won't work with any other version than they were
   created with.



  0.5.1 - Some more cosmetics
 =============================
 - Dircproxy parser has been fixed. The format seems to have changed.
 - Error- and warning-messages have been changed to provide more
   information about what's wrong and how it can be fixed.



  0.5.0 - Stable, at last
 =========================
 - The Conversations- and the Nicks-plugin both now ignore nicks that
   didn't write at least 100 lines. This value will be configurable in a
   later release.
 - The persistency data is ignored now, if the user configuration changes.
   This has caused some irritation in the past so I thought it would be
   good to implement..
 - Output fixes.. (Thanks Bob :)
 - A new theme, named ``liner'' after it's creator, has been added.
   Thanks a lot :)
 


  0.4.9 - Bugfixes and conversations
 ====================================
 - Workaround for MSIE issues have been implemented. Isn't it weird that
   such a widespread browser can;t even center a table the right way?!
 - A bug html-tag generation code has been fixed. Now all there's left to
   do is to use them ;)
 - The ``Conversations'' plugin has been added. It displays the persons
   with the most conversations.
 - The user config has been integrated a lot better into the nick-tracing
   code.
 - A bug in the persistency code has been fixed. Thanks to Bob Ball for
   reporting it :)



  0.4.8 - Look ma, that's me on the internet ;)
 ===============================================
 - Option to add an image to each nick has been added.
 - Option to ignore hosts/nicks has been added.
 - The newest time is now saved per-file, so the order of the input files
   doesn't matter anymore.
 - Files are no longer identified by their name, their inode numbers are
   used instead. This has not been tested unter M$ Windows!
 - New default config is to sort the users by words, not lines.
 - Fixed bug with the coloring-code (Thanks to Bob Ball for pointing this
   out :)



  0.4.7 - Colors and users
 ==========================
 - Added forgotten ident prefix `='.
 - Recognition of mIRC-color-codes has been added. (Thanks to Bob Ball for
   coding this :)
 - A user-configuration has been added which aloows to set specific
   information (like link, realname and image) for an user.



  0.4.6 - Yet another nasty bug fixed
 =====================================
 - A bug in the persistency code has been fixed: If the first line of a
   logfile had the same timestamp as the last line parsed in the previous
   run, the entire logfile would not be parsed.
 - An alternate config file can be set with the ``--config'' command line
   argument.



  0.4.5 - Purge option and fixes
 ================================
 - Option to automatically purge (truncate or delete) parsed logfiles has
   been added.
 - Input files will be sorted by mtime from now on. This addresses an
   issue with weird sorted input..
 - The dancer-parser has had a problem with the month of december (which
   has been taken care of ;)
 - A potential deivision by zero in Html.pm has been fixed.



  0.4.4 - Bugfix release
 ========================
 - Forgotten config options have been added again.
 - Fixes in the translation system.



  0.4.3 - Multilingualism
 =========================
 - A bug in the generated HTML code has been fixed.
 - Support for translations and a german translation has been added.
 - A parser for dancer-logs has been added (again).



  0.4.2 - Bugfix release
 ========================
 - An issue with perl 5.8.0 has been resolved: Time::Local tried to load
   ``Config'' and got onis' module with the same name.
 - A bug in the Eggdrop parser has been fixed: leave-events were not
   parsed correctly.
 - A parser for xchat has been added.



  0.4.1 - Added missing features and more
 =========================================
 - Internal restructure due to planned features.
 - The main table can now be sorted by lines, words or characters written.
 - Written lines, words and characters can be displayed at will. You can
   even chose between number only, bar only and both.
 - The overall-distribution of time spent chatting can be displayed.
 - A plugin named ``Interesting Numbers'' has been added. It brings back
   the information displayed by the ``Action'', ``Kicks'' and
   ``Soliloquies'' plugins.
 - URLs are now cut after 50 characters.
 - The daily activity stats now use characters (instead of lines) for
   greater precision.



  0.4.0 - Complete rewrite (testing)
 ====================================
 - Complete rewrite of huge parts of the program.
 - Improvments for nick-tracing.
 - Fixes for URL-Matching.
 - Better config-parsing.
 - Persistent data using ``Storable''.
 - New, lighter output theme.
 - Tons of other stuff I forgot to write down.



  0.3.3 - Major Feature Enhancements
 ====================================
 - Bug fixed: eggdrop and dircproxy logs wouldn't work with the kicks
   plugin. Thanks to Daniel Peters.
 - New plugin: nicks determines the nicks which were mentioned the most.
 - New plugin: channel tries to determine the channel's name. This only
   works with eggdrop, ircii, mirc and perlbot logs.
 - New plugin: topics lists the last topics set in the channel.
 - There are more configuration options for certain plugins.
 - onis uses Getopt::Long for some settings such as channel name or output
   file. Getopt::Long is part of the standard perl distribution.
 - Quotes taken out of the logfiles are now escaped and URLs are linked.
   There can be only one URL per line so far.
 - Bug fixed: You can now include images from other webservers in the
   config file.
 - Bug fixed: The words plugin now ignores nicks.



  0.3.0 - Major Feature Enhancements
 ====================================
 - Merged Fester's "extensions" into the main branch as "plugins". These 9
   (!) new plugins give a lot of useless information about the channel
   usage.
 - Added parsing modules for dancer- and dircproxy-logfiles. Thanks to
   Korbinian Rosenegger for writing the initial code.
 - Modularized the entire structure of onis.
 - The new comment-character is ';'. I though it would look better.
 - Updated the perlbot parser so it is compatible with perlbot 1.4.2



  0.2.0 - advanced and tested pre0.1.9
 ======================================
 - user-ranking scaleable (check the config-file)
 - improvment of the user-tracing. slows down when handling unknown nicks,
   so make sure to use the plugin if running perlbot!
 - source better documented
 - changed syntax!!
