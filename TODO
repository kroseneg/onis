- have config option to set min-lines for plugins

- the config reader could generate a warning if you
have a newline before a semicolon on a non-whitespace line?

-  remove the
elements from the bar where there is 0 activity - for example, the bar on the
number of lines...

- Finally, the other thing I think would be useful would be to exagerate the
bottom bar on the main table; its too small to see when the user is on at the
moment... so perhaps take a maximum (looks like the max is 100px?) and
minimum width (perhaps 50px?) for the bottom bar and then have the bars for
everyone inbetween scaled into this range?

- Another thing that would be useful is a config option for some HTML that is
put at the top of each stats page; so you can have links to other pages and
other things

Next few steps:
- Maybe use locales for m/\w/ and the like
- Dump to *SQL
- Write Apache-Style config parser
