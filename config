# This options tells onis what type of logfiles to expect. Valid values
# are ``Dircproxy'', ``Eggdrop'', ``Irssi'', ``mIRC'' and ``xchat''.
logtype: "Eggdrop";

# Thif option is available for scripts to set the input source once and
# for all. Since wildcards are not interpreted this is of little use for
# the averange user.
#input: "/path/to/my/file";

# Sets the output file. This has to be a file, not a directory. This is
# also mostly interesting for scripts.

# promting. Default is to ask.
overwrite: "false";

# Sets the users-config file to use. By default reads ``users.conf''.
#users_config: "users.conf";

# Purge logs that have been parsed. Two modes of operation can be
# selected: ``truncate'' deletes the content of file but lets the file
# life on. This might be usefull for clients that don't create new logs
# automatically.. The other mode, ``delete'', well, deletes parsed files.
# This might come in handy when a client creates a new logfile for every
# day.
#purge_logs: "truncate";

# Set this to your (nick)name to see it appear on the stats page. Uses
# your username if you don't set anything here.

# In order to recognize users who use dialin-accounts or have for some
# other reason changing hostnames it is neccessary to unsharp the host.
# This options says how much to unsharp it. Valid values are ``none'',
# ``Light'', ``Medium'' and ``Hard''. Most people will go best with
# ``Medium''..

longlines:  50;
shortlines: 10;

# The ``plugin_max'' option is used by various plugins to determine how
# many records (lines, rows, etc) should be printed.
plugin_max: 10;

# Matching the nicks contained in a line very slow. So we use a trick
# which is not as accurate but a lot faster. If you want to use the slow
# but better solution instead, set this option to ``good''. Otherwise
# leave at ``fast''.

# onis can create a ``persistency'' or ``history'' file. If such exists
# the already parsed part of a logfile can be skipped and unchanged
# logfiles are skipped entirely. However, for this to work you have to

# not wish onis to write and/or use such a file you can disable it here.
